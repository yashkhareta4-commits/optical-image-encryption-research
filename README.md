# Optical Image Encryption Using Fourier Transform Techniques

This repository contains my undergraduate research project completed
at The NorthCap University under academic supervision.

## Project Overview
- Studied optical image encryption using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
  and Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT).
- Applied double random phase encoding techniques for secure image processing.
- Performed security analysis including key space, correlation, and histogram analysis.

## Academic Context
- Undergraduate Research Project (2023)
- Supervisor: Dr. Savita Anjana
- Institution: The NorthCap University

## Note
This work was conducted as part of an academic research project
and is shared for educational and portfolio purposes.
